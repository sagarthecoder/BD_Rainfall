# BD_Rainfall

  The repo contains the code which predicts rainfall of Bangladesh.

## What is project about?

  The main objective of this project is to handle,explore,analyze the rainfall data of Bangladesh from 1948 to 2014 and predict the Average rainfall of  area and month wise (       total 35 areas of Bangladesh)

## What is the task?
  The task is to build an algorithm which predicts the average rainfall as month wise from 35 areas of Bangladesh.

## What action did I take?

  To predict the price, I had to tackle the problem following the standard data science pipelines. I cleaned the noisy data,analyze them,visualized them when necessary,performed   feature engineering and checked the performance using different machine learning algorithms. The actions were well described and demonstrated in the codes.

## Codes

* Rainfall.ipynb : The task of the code can subdivided in following groups

    - collect data from source.
    - setting up the environment.
    - Perform basic descriptive analysis from features.
    - Provide necessary visualization for the average rainfall prediction in some cases.
    - Subdividing the groups if needed.
    - Perform all necessary feature transform to perform machine learning algorithms.
    - Treat the problem as regression and applied SVM Algorithm and Decision Tree Regressor Algorithm.
    
  
 ## Results 
 
  From the analysis and result-comparision, I found that SVM Algorithm performed better that using Dicision Tree Regressor Algorithm.
 
## What could be done in the future

  - Using different regression algorithm and observe the performance.
  - Applying clever and smart technique to reduce the space complexity and time complexity.
